This repository represents the best code parts from my private projects for employers, universities, etc.

The best my skill is that I am sure that I can understand any technology by myself from JS-library to Math Statistics.

My hard skills include:
  - PHP
  - JS
  - GIT
  - Unix (Linux preferablely)
  - MVC
  - HTML+CSS
  - and more enough, so

from my point of view it completely isn't necessary to know some certain technologies, because for exmpl languages use the same OOP-concept, and the majority of them have a similar syntax.
so what is really important is knowing and understanding the main code patterns, basis principes of clean code, and further in this way

My most interesting soft skills are:
  - Russian (native-speaker)
  - Serbian (almost native)
  - English (B2 upper-intermediate)

All my skills I have been getting only from Web-resources, books, and seldom from video-lectures available in Internet. A great thanks to authors.

To discuss with me more about my skills (if you are organisation) or to argue about my thought said before, please write me in telegram @d1ntes
